# libbpclient
C library for BP client

# Usage
1. Prepare your compiler tools.
2. Edit the Makefile with your compiler tools.
Some platforms are supported already, like 'Makefile_esp8266'.
You can easily use it to override the old 'Makefile'.
3. Configure 'inc/bps_config.h' to fit your platform and meet your demands.

# Compiling
Build your library files use 'make'
$ make

Then you will get 'libbps.a' and 'libbps.so'.

Good luck~
